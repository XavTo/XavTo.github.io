At **ArasBurger**, our commitment to healthy fast food goes beyond just selecting the right ingredients. We employ specific cooking methods that preserve the nutritional value and enhance the flavor of our meals, all while incorporating **ARASGRASA** to boost their health benefits.

### **1. Grilling for Lean Proteins**

Grilling is one of our primary cooking methods, especially for our burgers. This technique allows excess fats to drip away, resulting in leaner meals without sacrificing taste. Grilled proteins retain their natural juices and essential nutrients, making them a healthier choice for our customers.

### **2. Steaming Vegetables**

To ensure our vegetable sides are both delicious and nutritious, we use steaming as our preferred cooking method. Steaming preserves the vitamins and minerals in vegetables, maintaining their vibrant colors and fresh flavors. This method complements our **ARASGRASA**-enhanced ingredients, providing a balanced and healthful addition to your meal.

### **3. Minimal Use of Healthy Fats**

We prioritize the use of healthy fats in our cooking processes. Instead of deep frying, we opt for techniques that require minimal oil, such as sautéing and baking. When oil is necessary, we use heart-healthy options like olive oil or avocado oil, ensuring that our meals are both tasty and good for your heart.

### **4. Incorporating ARASGRASA**

**ARASGRASA** plays a crucial role in our cooking methods. This key ingredient enhances the nutritional profile of our dishes by adding essential proteins, fibers, and healthy fats. Whether it's our high-protein vegetarian meals or our vegan french fries, **ARASGRASA** ensures that every bite is both satisfying and nourishing.

### **5. Portion Control and Balanced Meals**

Our cooking methods are designed to promote balanced meals. By carefully controlling portion sizes and combining proteins, carbohydrates, and vegetables, we ensure that each meal provides a well-rounded nutritional profile. This approach helps our customers maintain a balanced diet without feeling deprived.
